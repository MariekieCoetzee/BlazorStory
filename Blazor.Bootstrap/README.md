# Blazor Bootstrap

This project is created on a template created by [jsakamoto](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/)'s 
ingenious work on [BlazingStory](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/) and Bootstrap as the CSS framework.  
The template, BlazingStory, draws inspiration from 
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), the well known tool for UI development in the JavaScript ecosystem. 
BlazingStory template brings the 
power of component isolation to Blazor, revolutionizing the way we build UI pages and components.

## Component Isolation for Speedy Development

[BlazingStory](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/) allows developers to construct UI pages and components
in an isolated environment. This unique approach significantly accelerates the development process. By isolating
components, developers can swiftly iterate, experiment, and fine-tune our creations. Once component parameters are
set, the component code becomes easily transferable, streamlining our workflow.

# TechStack
The client project is developed with the following tech & libraries :
- **NET 8 Preview**
- **Bootstrap 5**: Utilize the  styling and responsive design features of Bootstrap 5 .
- **BlazingStory**: Drawing inspiration from Storybook, BlazingStory empowers Blazor developers to embrace component 
  isolation and elevate our development process.
