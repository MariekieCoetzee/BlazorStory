# BlazorStory

This repository, derived from [jsakamoto](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/)'s ingenious work on [BlazingStory](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/), draws inspiration from Storybook, 
the well known tool for UI development in the JavaScript ecosystem. BlazorStory brings the 
power of component isolation to Blazor, revolutionizing the way we build UI pages and components.

## Component Isolation for Speedy Development

[BlazingStory](https://github.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/) allows developers to construct UI pages and components
in an isolated environment. This unique approach significantly accelerates the development process. By isolating
components, developers can swiftly iterate, experiment, and fine-tune our creations. Once component parameters are
set, the component code becomes easily transferable, streamlining our workflow.

# TechStack
The client project is developed with the following tech & libraries :
- **NET 8 Preview**
- **Bootstrap 5**: Utilize the  styling and responsive design features of Bootstrap 5 .
- **BlazingStory**: Drawing inspiration from Storybook, BlazingStory empowers Blazor developers to embrace component 
  isolation and elevate our development process.
